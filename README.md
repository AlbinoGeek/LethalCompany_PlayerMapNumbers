# Radar Ident QuickSwitch

## Overview

Radar Ident QuickSwitch is a mod for Lethal Company that allows you to quickly switch between different radar targets using their simple identifier (a single-digit number by default.) This mod aims to enhance the quality-of-life and user experience of the terminal operator by providing a more efficient way to manage radar targets.

## Compatibility

- Compatible with version 40 or 45 of the game.
- Tested to work with MoreCompany without issues.

## Features

- Quick and easy switching between radar targets
- Customizable identifier length (coming soon)

## Installation

### Using r2modman or thunderstore Client

1. Install the Radar Ident QuickSwitch mod.

### Using the Manual Download Method

1. Download the Radar Ident QuickSwitch mod.
2. Extract the zip into your BepInEx directory.

## Usage

Once installed, you will see (by default) digits appear over the icons of your radar targets. These digits are the identifiers for each target. To switch to a target, simply type the identifier of the target you wish to switch to. For example, if you want to switch to the target with the identifier `1`, you would type `1` and press enter. The target with the identifier `1` will now be selected as if you had used the `switch` command with their full name.
